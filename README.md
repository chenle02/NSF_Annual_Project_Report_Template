# Products

> Product Information
> 
> Publications are the characteristic product of research. Agencies evaluate

> the research and the efficacy with which the results are being communicated
> to colleagues, potential users, and the public, not the number of
> publications.
> 
> Many projects (though not all) develop significant products other than
> publications. Agencies assess and report both publications and other products
> to Congress, communities of interest, and the public.
> 
> Datasets added in the NSF Public Access Repository (NSF-PAR) will be listed

# Impact

Impact - What is the impact of the project? How has it contributed?

> Over the years, this base of knowledge, techniques, people, and
> infrastructure is drawn upon again and again for application to commercial
> technology and the economy, to health and safety, to cost-efficient
> environmental protection, to the solution of social problems, to numerous
> other aspects of the public welfare, and to other fields of endeavor.
> 
> The taxpaying public and its representatives deserve a periodic assessment to
> show them how the investments they make benefit the nation. Through this
> reporting format, and especially this section, recipients provide that
> assessment and make the case for Federal funding of research and education.
> 
> Agencies use this information to assess how their research programs:
> 
> 1. increase the body of knowledge and techniques;
> 2. enlarge the pool of people trained to develop that knowledge and
>    techniques or put it to use; and
> 3. improve the physical, institutional, and information resources that enable
>    those people to get their training and perform their functions.

> impact the work has had on knowledge and technique. Make the best distinction
> possible, for example, by using a "field" or "discipline", if appropriate,
> that corresponds with a single academic department (i.e., physics rather than
> nuclear physics).
> 
> For NSF purposes, the paragraph should read, How the fields or disciplines
> are defined is not as important as covering the impact the work has had on
> knowledge and technique.
> 
> For NSF purposes, provide description of postdoctoral mentoring, graduate
> student mentoring, or other mentoring.
